# Next Steps
We did it! Don't forget to add each system to the `App.new()` and test out the
game. Check out [my repository](https://github.com/mattrost/meteors) to see the
full code that I have made so far for this project.

Here are a few things you should try to do to build upon your Rust and Bevy skills:
- Add in timed asteroid spawning that increases difficulty with more time played
- Find my hidden bug that causes the game to panic on some asteroid despawns.
I think this happens when the player is touching the asteroid as it is de-spawned, or
when the edge warp is happening during the de-spawn.
- Implement events, like keeping track of player score
- Add in sprites for the ship, laser, and asteroids to improve aesthetics.
- Make your own game!
